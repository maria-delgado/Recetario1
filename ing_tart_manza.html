            <ul>
                
                <li>6 Eggs.</li>
                <li>100g Of butter.</li>
                <li>1kg Of apples for the dough.</li>
                <li>3 Apples to decorate the pie.</li>
                <li>100g Of cornstarch.</li>
                <li>120g Of sugar.</li>
                <li>500ml Of milk cream.</li>
                <li>Peach jam needed to decorate.</li>
                <li>370g Of condensed milk.</li>
                <li>Syrup.</li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <p>Steps to follow</p>
            
            <ol>
                
                <img src="1tarman.jpg" align="right" height="300px" width="280px">
                <li>We will start by putting in a glass crusher the kilograms of peeled, heart-broken and cut-up apples, eggs, sugar and butter at the point of ointment. We will place the lid and grind at a good speed.</li>
                <li>When we have all crushed, we will lower the speed and add the condensed milk through the hole that is in the center of the lid. In case you do not have it, you will have to stop, add the condensed milk and beat again.</li>
                <li>While the mixture is finished, we will peel and cut the 3 apples that we have reserved to decorate. What you see in the photo, is a mandolin that has made this work much easier.</li>
                <li>Once we have made the mixture, we will have a bowl with the cream and corn starch, which we will mix well before adding the mixture we have in the crusher.</li>
                <li>We will perfectly integrate all the components and then we will pour the whole mixture into a removable rectangular mold of 30x40 cm, in which we will have placed a baking paper caught between the base and the wall, so that there can be no mass leaks.</li>
                <li>Now cover the entire surface of the cake with apple slices mounted on top of each other to make better aesthetic effect and light the oven at 180ºC with heat up and down WITHOUT a fan, and when it is hot we will put the mold and bake the apple pie for approximately 50 minutes. The time may vary depending on the oven and the thickness of the pie.</li>
                <li>After that time we will remove the apple pie from the oven and paint it with peach jam.</li>
                <li>In that the cake is cold at all, we will prepare a syrup in a saucepan putting 4 tablespoons of sugar and a small glass of water. Dissolve the sugar and then let it thicken a little. Once the syrup is finished, we will unmold the cake and paint the surface with it and let it cool.</li>
