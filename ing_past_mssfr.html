            </ul>
            
            <p>Steps to follow</p>
            
            <ol>
                
                <li>First we made the sponge cake that will make the base for our mousse. The first thing is to beat with a few sticks the very soft butter, the salt and the sugar. When they are mixed we add the eggs one by one while continuing to beat.</li>
                <li>Add a few drops of vanilla essence and mix the flour with the yeast. While stirring add the dry ingredients to tablespoons until they are well integrated. We preheat the oven to 180ยบ and place a waxed paper on a baking sheet. We put the dough in a pastry bag and we peeled it in a circular shape on the baking paper.</li>
                <li>We introduce it into the oven at 180ยบ until it sticks out with the toothpick and comes out clean. We'll let it cool.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, we will mount the cream in a cold bowl to make it better. When it is a little hard we add half of the sugar destined to the mousse in the form of rain and without stopping to beat. When we see that the rods make yellow grooves in the cream is that this will already be. We reserve it at room temperature.</li>
                <li>We crush 300g of strawberries until they are pureed and we toss them in a saucepan with a gentle fugue. We add the remaining sugar, lemon juice and yogurt and heat it without it boiling.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a glass with a squirt of milk, about 100ml, we mix the gelatin to hydrate it and add it to the hot saucepan, which we will heat for a few minutes so that the gelatine is well integrated. We turn off the fire and reserve it until it cools, very important.</li>
                <li>We cut the sponge cake with the round shape and surround it with an adaptable metal ring. We cut in half the 200g of strawberries that were left over and placed them by the edge of the cake, with the cut part stuck to the walls of the metal mold.</li>
                <li>When the strawberry shake has cooled, add it little by little to the whipped cream and mix it with enveloping movements so that the cream does not come down and does not cut. Pour the mixture into the mold and smooth it well. Finally we take it to the fridge until it sets and we decorate it as we want.</li>
